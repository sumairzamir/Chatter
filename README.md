# Project Overview
An app that showcases iOS development learning. The app demonstrates proficiency in these four areas:

+ Building sophisticated and polished user interfaces with UIKit components
+ Downloading data from network resources
+ Persisting state on the device
+ Researching and integrating new libraries

# Specifications
+ The app contains multiple pages of interface in a navigation controller or tab controller, or a single view controller with a view that shows and hides significant new content.
+ The user interface includes more than one type of control.
+ The app includes data from a networked source.
+ The networking code is encapsulated in its own classes.
+ The app clearly indicates network activity, displaying activity indicators and/or progress bars when appropriate.
+ The app displays an alert view if the network connection fails.
+ The app has a persistent state that is stored using Core Data or a service with local persistence capabilities (e.g. Firebase or Realm).
